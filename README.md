# assemblefile

Working copy of my assemblefile. Working on my system, of course. Posted for your viewing pleasure. This repo only includes
the assemblefile.js and the various parts in the /app directory. It is about 75% complete. Maybe less depending on what 
else I learn from the Assemble project.
